Comp 20 Lab 5: My Old Kentucky Home

Cameron Flowers March 3, 2016

The goal of the assignment is to practice using JavaScript, 
the Document Object Model (DOM), Event Handling and HTML5 to
embed a music video to a web page and live annotate it using
event handling in a karaoke fashion. I believe this work has
been implemented correctly according to the homework guidelines.

I did not collaborate with anyone.

I spent approximately 2.5 hours to complete the assignment.
