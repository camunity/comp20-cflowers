Comp 20 Assignment 2: Landmarks

Cameron Flowers 

March 16, 2016

The goal of the assignment was to retrieve my current location (latitude and longitude) and send it to a datastore. Next, I retrieve and display the 
locations of other people in my class as well as the nearest historic landmarks
on a map using a number of APIs. Finally I calculated the closest historic
landmark, and rendered a polyline to it. This assignment sharpened my skills in
parsing JSON data after making JSON API calls, using javascript API's like
Google Maps and using HTML5 geolocation API to determine my location. I also 
had to make use of JavaScript associative arrays, lists, and the XMLHttpRequest 
object. I believe this work has been implemented correctly according to the 
homework guidelines.

I did not collaborate with anyone.

I spent approximately 8 hours to complete the assignment.
