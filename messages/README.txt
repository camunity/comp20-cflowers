The goal of the assignment is to practice parsing JSON data, 
using JavaScript associative arrays, the XMLHttpRequest object,
and viewing the limitations of client-side javascript. I believe
this work has been implemented correctly according to the 
homework guidelines.

I did not collaborate with anyone.

I spent approximately 2.5 hours to complete the assignment.

What was learned:

It is possible to request data from a different origin, but due to security reasons, XMLHttpRequest abides by the same-origin-policy meaning that it will only work if requests are made to the same host that served the webpage.
