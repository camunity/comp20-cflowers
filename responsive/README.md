Comp 20 Lab 4: Responsive CSS

Cameron Flowers Feb 18, 2016

The goal of the assignment is to create a responsive 
CSS file named responsive.css in order to create a web 
page that shows a different part of the image based on
the size of the browser screen. I believe this work has
been implemented correctly according to the homework
 guidelines.

I did not collaborate with anyone.

I spent approximately 6-8 hours to complete the assignment.
